__Developers need a way to create web based software faster.__

Not because any particular tool chain or framework is bad, but because we
should always try to do better.

Current solutions have at least one of these problems:

* Challenging to get started for folks who are new to the solution.
* Difficult to deploy to production environments.
* Offer poor plugin APIs.
* Challenging for new developers to grok.
* Suffer from poor documentation.

The result is that building a website or web application is more complicated
than is should be, and, consequently, web projects take longer than they
should.
