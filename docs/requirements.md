Requirements
============

Conservation of developer time is the mandate of Enginemill.

*Every decision made in the development of Enginemill must optimize for web
application development speed.*

### Documentation
Perhaps the most effective means of reducing development time is to have
stellar developer documentation. Documentation should include:

* How-to Guides
* Examples
* Developer Tools
* Reference Documentation

It's important to understand that developers come at all points in the typical
developer career, at different skill levels, with different goals, and different
methods of learning. It is impossible to tailor to each individual, but the
Enginemill documentation should provide material in enough different formats,
and contexts that each individual can tailor their own experience.

* Some docs should be written for beginners and marked as such.
* There should be enough documentation outside of the reference docs for new users to get started with minimal
hassle, and feel good about accomplishing something.
* Some docs should be written for advanced developers, and marked as such.
* There should be no fear of repeating or duplicating content in the documentation.
* Documentation should *not* be dumbed down to the point where bad habits and booby traps lie in wait for users as they move on and become more experienced.
